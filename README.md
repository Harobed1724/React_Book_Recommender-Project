# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses Babel for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses SWC for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled by default due to its impact on dev & build performance. To enable it, refer to the [official React Compiler documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler).

## Expanding the ESLint Configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enabling type-aware lint rules.  
Check out the [Vite + TypeScript template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for details on integrating TypeScript and `typescript-eslint` in your project.
